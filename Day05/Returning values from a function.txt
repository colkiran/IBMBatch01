Returning values from a function
--------------------------------
How many values can a function return


def fun()
   return a, b, c, d


res = fun()
res will store it in the form of a tuple


passing  arguments to the function
----------------------------------

doc string - strings that are not assinged to any variable

" " and ' ' are used to store single line string

"""  """ or '''    '''  can be used to store multiple lines
                                 

Scope of a variable
-------------------
1. Global 
2. Local
3. Non Local - enclosed
4. Built-in

Local - Lexical - within a block of code

variable declared inside the function cannot be accessed outside the function

Builtin Scope
-------------
Its a special scope which is created or loaded at script run or opens an interactive session

This scope contains names such as Keywords, Functions, Exceptions and other attributes that are built into python

Names in this scope are also available from everywhere in your code

try:

except:


OOP's
-----
why should I implement OOPS in my project


1. encapsulation - we bind all the modules into one project 
2. polymorphism  - 
3. Inheritance   -
4. abstraction   - 


Old rules - checking - access card

New Rules - Cameras AI - Uniform along with access card

ATM - 

Polymorphism - gold card(1 lakhs), platinum card(2.5 lakhs), shopping card (40k per day)

Inheritance - SBI 10k +, 4 digit code to the mobile and use it withdraw the amount

abstraction - Hardware and Software in it

Encapsulation - Hardware + Software - ATM


__init__ = double underscore init
	 = dunder init


class attribute or class variable
---------------------------------
class attribute are accessed with class name 

they are declared inside a class and outside the methods

they are static and its values are common accross objects


Methods
-------
1. instance method - accessed with the object of a class
2. class method - accessed with the class name
3. static method - accessed directly without class name or object
