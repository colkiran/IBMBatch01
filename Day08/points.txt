Packages and Modules
--------------------

package - directory or folder

packages are used to store libraries(modules)

Modules are same as libraries
-----------------------------
all python files and modules will have the same extension .py

any python file can be treated as a module


import module
-------------
1. location where modules or libraries can be stored

2. adding a .pth file in python native path

3. module extensions will change from .py to .pyc (compiled copy of the file) file and gets stored in a folder __pycache__

4. when we import a module from the second time onwards - python will start comparing the date and time of creation or modification of .py and.pyc file.
Python expects the .pyc file to have the latest date and time


import mymodule
from mymodule import a class
from mymoduel import a function
import mypackage.mymodule as m
from mypackage import mymodule

from mypackage import *
 
packages - classes
------------------

class  - create an object of a class then we call the constructor

package - first the __init__.py file will get executed


Regular Expressions
--------------------
pattern - to match a particular requirement

?
*

dir *.txt  - * will represent the file name - 1 to any number of characters

dir ?a*.txt - will match all files with second character as a


Oracle Server - restarting due to file insertion - size too large - username -- 23/10/2023 - 10:15 PM
