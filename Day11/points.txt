Multi Threading
---------------

Code what we write gets executed synchonously (sequentially - line by line) 

def fun():
   pass  -> 10 secs to execute


fun()	-> 10 secs
fun()   -> 10 secs


Threads
-------
GIL - does not support threads in python

so solve this issue we have a special module called multithreading

NOSET			0

Python and TK - TKinter
-----------------------

TK is built using TCL

TK bocomes the GUI for technologies like C, C++, PERL, RUBY, Python



Numpy
-----
numerical Python

found by travis Oliphant - 2005

number data 	-> convert these collection of numbers into numpy object -> we can implement numpy library based functions to manipulate it

numpy arrays are stored at one continous place in memory unlike lists, hence its faster compared to lists

This behaviour is called locality of reference
col no.	     0 1 2 3

0th row   -  1 2 3 4   
1st row	  -  5 6 7 8


Pandas
------

MC Kiney - 2008

huge data of 25 cols and 50000 rows

take this data and convert it into pandas object - Dataframe

invalid row and cols are removed from this dataframe (nullvalues, invalid data)

we will filter the data 

then we summarise the data and then send it to analytics team

they will pick this summarised information and plot graphs


if we have a single row then we call it as series
